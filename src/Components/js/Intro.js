                    I was born and raised in West Bengal, India. I have completed my Diploma in Electrical Engineering in 2019. Afterward, 
                    I transitioned into software engineering, driven by a deep passion for full-stack web development—a field that offers endless opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. 
                    I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Node.js, and MongoDB, and I continually strive to reach new heights in my expertise.<br/><br/>

                    Throughout my journey, I have built numerous projects using these technologies, tackling real-world challenges that have strengthened my problem-solving abilities. 
                    My passion for coding extends beyond project work; I am eager to understand how the industry leverages programming to build reliable, production-level software solutions. 
                    I am seeking an entry-level position to begin my career, where I can apply my dedication and adaptability in a reputable organization.<br/><br/>

                    Outside of work, I enjoy photography, cooking, and exploring the world—hobbies that enhance my creativity and curiosity. 
                    My key strengths include hard work, self-motivation, multitasking, problem-solving, effective time management, and performing well under pressure.
                    These qualities empower me to complete projects efficiently and with attention to detail.
